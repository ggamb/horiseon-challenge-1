## The Repository

This repository is where I refactored the HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon website to improve SEO via semantic HTML tags, added comments to the HTML and CSS, removed duplicative CSS, and made other miscellaneous improvements. This chellenge was crucial to improving my understanding of HTML, CSS, and creating professional READMEs. This challenge forced me to think of HTML elements as a way of improving search engine optimzation (SEO) and communicating the type of content included in the elements (e.g. the section element instead of the div element).
